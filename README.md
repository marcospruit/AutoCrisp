# Welcome to Auto-CRISP.

This is the R-Shiny prototype codebase which implements the CRISP-DM process to empower healthcare professionals, thus instantiating the concept of Self-Service Data Science. Auto-CRISP was developed in 2018 by Niels de Vries at Utrecht University, as part of his MSC research project: Making Machine Learning accessible to Healthcare Professionals for the purpose of predicting Medical Adverse Events.

The prototype design rationale and evaluations have been summarised in the following research paper:

(Eds.), Springer Proceedings in Complexity, Research and Innovation Forum 2020: Disruptive Technologies in Times of Change (pp. 517â€“535). RII 2020, Athens, Greece: Springer. 

A clinical employment of Auto-CRISP is described in a research paper which is currently under review.
