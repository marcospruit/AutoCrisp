# Welcome to Auto-CRISP.

This is the R-Shiny prototype codebase which was developed originally by Niels de Vries at Utrecht University, as part of his MSC research project, primarily supervised by Marco Spruit. The prototype design rationale and evaluations have been desribed in the following research paper:
